| April 5 |      9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                    I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Oct 10  |  10:55-11:55 am  |                                                                                                                       In class discussion. Thought about possible solutions like binary search and tries while using some sort of dictionary. |
| Oct 14  |   8:55-9:55 am   |                                                                                Continued in class discussion. Created my map with 4 spots filled with each binary value representing each letter in their corresponding order in the alphabet |
| Oct 21  | 11:00 - 11:55 am | I created my variables, chose my prime number, and used Horner's method to create my hash function. I use this function to hash any string given to the function into a unqiue integer variables for faster comparisons later on in the code. |
| Oct 22  | 10:30 - 11:00 pm |                                         I began my The Rabin-Karp Fingerprint Algorithm using my hash function I created previously. I used the function to hash the str and the sequence to use in the The Rabin-Karp Fingerprint Algorithm. |
| Oct 23  | 9:00 - 10:00 am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
