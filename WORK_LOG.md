| April 5 |      9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Oct 10  |  10:55-11:55 am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In class discussion. Thought about possible solutions like binary search and tries while using some sort of dictionary. |
| Oct 14  |   8:55-9:55 am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Continued in class discussion. Created my map with 4 spots filled with each binary value representing each letter in their corresponding order in the alphabet |
| Oct 21  | 11:00 - 11:55 am |                                                                                                                                        I created my variables, chose my prime number, and used Horner's method to create my hash function. I use this function to hash any string given to the function into a unique integer variables for faster comparisons later on in the code. |
| Oct 22  | 10:30 - 11:00 pm |                                                                                                                                                                                         I began myRabin-Karp Fingerprint Algorithm using my hash function I created previously. I used the function to hash the str and the sequence to use in the Rabin-Karp Fingerprint Algorithm. |
| Oct 23  | 9:00 - 10:00 am  |                                                    I tried finishing my Rabin-Karp Fingerprint Algorithm. I fixed an index out of bounds error when I try to get my next hash. I created a variable to store the radix exponent. I also did the comparisons to find my current and max counts of the repeats. I still have some sort of calculate error as my answers are incorrect. |
| Oct 24  | 10:10 - 10:40 am |                                                                                      I add a while loop to count the amount of strs in a row and to increment the current count. I had to fixe a few index out of bounds errors that I was getting from my for loop and hash functions that I fixed I am still getting time outs and incorrect counts for certain some of the tests. |
| Oct 30  |  10:00 - 10:30   | I fixing the calculation error by first changing how I incremented i in imy for loop. I also added an if statement within the while loop to make sure there were no index out of bounds errors. I also changed how I set my current variable by setting it to zero at the beginning of the loop and checking if it was zero later on to slide the hash of next part of the sequence. |
| Oct 30  |  10:30 - 11:00   |                                                                                                                                            I had to add an if statment to the part where I slide the hash as there could be an index out of bounds when I try to use char at if I don't check that i is less than the sequence length - the length of the str. I also added comments |
